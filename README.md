# Description

<!-- Plugin description -->

## Create custom "scopes" for any target branch. Selectable in a tool window, which is called **GIT SCOPE**.

The Current "scope" is displayed/available as

- diff in the tool window
- "line status" in the "line gutter"
- custom "scope" and finally as a
- status bar widget

### Note

When upgrading from a previous version of this plugin, make sure that you enable the native gutter highlighting via
`Tools -> Diff & Merge -> Highlight modified lines in gutter`

Previous versions disabled this setting, and it hooks into the native gutter highlighter instead.

### Story

Most developers enjoy using version control to inspect code changes before a commit. However, after committing, all
version control changes and line statuses are lost. Since branches often consist of multiple commits, this plugin makes
those commits intuitively visible again.

### Modifications in Detail

**Change Browser:**

Adds a tool window with a "change browser" (similar to version control) that displays the current diff of the **GIT
SCOPE**.

**Line Status Gutter:**

Adjusts the line status according to your **GIT SCOPE**. Normally this built-in feature shows only the current "HEAD"
changes

**Scope:**

Adds a custom *Scope* (used to do inspections, search/replace, ect), i.e. search results are filtered by **GIT SCOPE**.

**Status Bar Widget**

To see the current selection of the Git Scope even when the tool window is not open, you can look at the status bar
widget.
